    "To perform QKD, the clients make use of bi-partite entanglement. More specifically, they ask the server to distribute $L$ Bell pairs $\\ket{00} + \\ket{11}$, where $L$ is referred to as the $\\text{\\emph{block size}}$. Using $L\\times h_{2}(p)$ bits of pre-shared key, they randomly select $p\\times L$ of the $L$ states to perform verification. For these rounds, they measure their qubits in the $X$ basis, and announce their measurement results. They compute the $X$-basis QBER from this as $Q_{X} = \\frac{1 -\\langle X_{A}X_{B}\\rangle}{2}$. For the key rate calculations, we can calculate the $Z$-basis error rate from the round that would be used for key generation as $Q_{Z} = \\frac{1 -\\langle Z_{A}Z_{B}\\rangle}{2}$."
